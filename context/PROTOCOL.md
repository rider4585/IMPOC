# Hive protocol

You are one of several Claude agents sharing this hive. Coordination is entirely
file-based; the harness (main process) is the only thing that runs git and the
only thing that moves messages between agents.

**Words.** An *agent* is a member of this office with a lasting session. A *temp* is a short lived agent
the orchestrator starts for one job; it does the job, reports done, and is torn down. The orchestrator's
address is `god`.

## Your workspace — `agents/<your-id>/`
- `identity.md`  — who you are (read-only; the harness writes it).
- `memory.md`    — your long-term memory. Read at the start of a task; append to it as you learn.
- `inbox/`       — messages addressed to you. Read them at the start of a task.
- `inbox/.done/` — move a message here once you've handled it.
- `outbox/`      — drop messages here to send them. The harness delivers them.

**Never write into another agent's folder.** Write to your own `outbox/`; the
orchestrator routes it. This keeps every file single-writer.

## Sending a message
Write one JSON file into `outbox/` (any filename ending in `.json`):

```json
{
  "to": "<agent-id> | god | broadcast | member:<memberId> (a teammate on another machine; Teams only, ids come from the roster line)",
  "act": "request | inform | propose | query | agree | refuse | done",
  "subject": "one-line summary",
  "body": "the details",
  "conversation": "carry this across a thread (optional)",
  "in_reply_to": "<message id you're replying to> (optional)"
}
```

The harness fills in `id`, `from`, `hops`, and timestamps.

## Rules of the road
- Only `request`, `query`, and `propose` expect a reply. `inform` and `done` are terminal —
  don't reply to them, or two agents will loop forever.
- For anything ambiguous, cross-cutting, or needing sign-off, message `god` — the
  god agent clarifies answers for you so you rarely need the human directly.
- There is NO separate human-approval queue. Human-in-the-loop is native to Claude
  Code: a tool you run that needs permission prompts in your own session (the human
  can approve it remotely from their phone via `/remote-control`). If you genuinely
  need a human decision, raise it with `god` (a message `"to": "human"` is routed to
  the god/orchestrator, the human's proxy on the floor).
- `board.md` is the shared plan. Don't edit it directly — `propose` changes to `god`,
  who is its sole scribe.
- Re-reading a message you already moved to `.done/` is a no-op. Don't reprocess.

## The work: board.md vs tasks.json
There are two shared surfaces, both in the hive root:
- `board.md` — the freeform narrative plan. The god agent is its sole scribe; others `propose` edits.
- `tasks.json` — the structured task ledger (a kanban: `todo / doing / blocked / done`, with title,
  assignee, priority, deps). Keep the task you're working reflected in its status.

## Asking the human (the ASK ME card)
When a card can only move with the human — a question to answer, or an action only they can do
(create an account, approve a spend, hand over credentials, test on their device) — the god sets the
card `"status": "blocked"` and appends the ask to its `humanQA` array:

```json
{ "q": "the ask, in markdown", "askedAt": "<iso timestamp>" }
```

The harness shows the open ask on the ASK ME board and in the ASK ME tab, and the human's reply lands
in the same entry as `"a"` plus an inbox message to god. Every past entry stays on the card — that
trail is the decision history.

**Write the ask short, and in markdown.** The card renders it, so plain-text asterisks and backticks
show up literally, and a card is not a terminal — an ask longer than a short paragraph plus its
options (roughly 700 characters) is a report, not a question. Cut the narrative and keep the decision:
- open with ONE **bold** sentence saying exactly what you need from them;
- `backticks` for paths, commands, values, and identifiers;
- `-` bullets or `1.` numbering for every option or step;
- a blank line between paragraphs; a single newline is rendered as a line break, so each option
  stays on its own line.

When the ask originates in another agent's report, REWRITE it into that shape. Never paste the report
body in as the question, and never make the human read the investigation to find the decision. Do NOT park human questions in separate files (no `HumanQuestion.md`),
and never sit idle waiting for a reply — move on to other work and pick the answer up when it arrives.

## Guardrails: circuit breaker & token budgets
A circuit breaker watches every agent for runaway behavior (looping on the same tool, error storms,
overspending). It escalates gently: `steer` → `constrain` → `stop`. If a `Circuit breaker: steer`
or `Circuit breaker: constrain` message lands in your inbox, you ARE the problem it caught — stop
repeating, summarize what you've tried, and do exactly what the message says (constrain = go read-only
and get god's sign-off before more tool calls). Be **token-frugal**: the floor has a token budget and
each agent can have its own token limit; crossing it trips the breaker. Prefer references over pasted
content, and `/compact` your own session when context gets heavy.

## Fleet monitoring (orchestrator)
You (god) are responsible for situational awareness. To see the live state of every agent, read
`fleet.json` in the hive root — it is refreshed continuously with each agent's tokens, cost, status,
breaker level, last tool, last-active time, and inbox backlog. Pair it with `registry.json` (the roster)
and `log.jsonl` (the event feed). IMPORTANT: `claude agents` will NOT show your hive's sibling
sessions (they're spawned independently) — `fleet.json` is your source of truth for them. For a deeper
look at one agent, read its `agents/<id>/memory.md` and `inbox/`, or send it a `query`. A full
Claude Code command reference (slash = your own session only; CLI = your shell, can target the fleet)
is in `COMMANDS.md` in the hive root.

## Starting a temp (orchestrator)
You can start a temp yourself. Write ONE JSON file into `spawn-requests/<id>.json` in the hive root:

```json
{
  "objective": "the job (required)",
  "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/the/repo (required)",
  "name": "display name (optional)",
  "command": "engine CLI (optional; defaults to the configured one)",
  "provider": "claude | codex | cursor | antigravity | … (optional)",
  "model": "model override (optional)",
  "isolate": true,
  "tokenCap": 0,
  "slack": { "channel": "C…", "thread_ts": "…" },
  "character": "meredith",
  "accent": "coral"
}
```

The harness polls that directory, starts the temp with id `worker-<id>`, briefs it with the objective,
the memory index and its capabilities, and moves the request to `spawn-requests/.done/` once it starts
or to `spawn-requests/.failed/` with a reason. `isolate` defaults to true, giving the temp its own git
worktree. `slack` sends its replies and failures to that thread. `character` and `accent` set how it
looks on the floor; naming it after a cast member already gets that avatar, and an unknown value falls
back rather than failing. This is the only way you can start anyone: a hire manifest under
`research/hires/` needs the human to confirm it in the UI.

**The switch.** The human allows temps under Settings, Autonomy & Budgets. It is OFF by default, because
every temp spends tokens nobody approved, and it caps how many run at once. While it is off your request
is neither failed nor deleted: it waits in `spawn-requests/` and runs when the switch is turned on. A
request that has not moved means the switch is off; raise it with the human instead of retrying. When
Slack triage is set to temps, the harness starts those temps itself, switch or not. Route work to an
agent already on the floor first either way.

## Capabilities
Your skills are copied into `agents/<your-id>/.claude/skills/` when you start. Read
`capabilities/SKILL.md` there once (or run `/capabilities`): it lists the date skills (`/today`,
`/lastWeek`, `/last30Days`, `/lastQuarter` and more), which resolve any time window so you never
compute dates by hand, and the integrations reached through the loopback broker. The broker is a temp's:
it is available only when `MD_BROKER_URL` is set in your environment. Without it, ask `god`.

## Semantic memory (optional — when `mempalace` is installed)
When `MEMPALACE_PALACE_PATH` is set in your environment, the hive shares a
searchable MemPalace and you have the `mempalace` CLI:
- `mempalace search "<query>"` — recall relevant past knowledge across the whole
  team by meaning (not just keywords). Add `--wing <agent-id>` to scope to one
  agent, `--results N` to widen.
- `mempalace wake-up` — a short digest of what matters, good at the start of a task.

Your `memory.md` is mined into the palace automatically, so the durable facts you
write there become searchable by every agent. You don't run `mine` yourself.
